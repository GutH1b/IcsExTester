Disclamer:
 - Passing the tests on the application does NOT gurantee passing in the submit program.

Config file:
- In the config.env file, make to enter valid paths to your exe files.
- In the "TimeoutMS" field, entering 0 is used to not limit the runtime of the programs.

Important notes:
- In Ex4 task2, this application only tests "theoretically finite" strings, limited at length 40. 
  make sure to test longer strings yourself.

Contact me if you think anything is wrong/missing.
